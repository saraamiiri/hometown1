      <h1>SHIRAZ; the beauty of persian cultare and history</h1>
      <p>Shiraz is one of the destinations that you will definitely want to visit when travelling to Iran. With Persepolis, Pasargadae, Hafez Tomb, Saadi Tomb and so many other historical and cultural attractions, we can call Shiraz the beauty of Persian culture and history. This city is well-known not only for its historic houses, gardens and mosques, but also for the famous poets (Hafez and Saadi) who were born and raised in the city.</p>
